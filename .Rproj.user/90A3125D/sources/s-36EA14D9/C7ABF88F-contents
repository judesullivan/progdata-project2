# progdata-project2
This is my second portfolio project for Programming with Data.

Here, I expand upon research from my honors thesis that looked at how facets of men's identity relate to their experiences with masculinity. Namely, I investigated how men's race/ethnicity and sexual orientation correspond to differences in their gender stereotype trait ratings, gendered self-view trait ratings, and precarious manhood belief ratings. 

In this project, I am specifically interested in looking at precarious manhood belief ratings in the United States, as my honors thesis included a sample of over 700 men from Australia, Canada, England, Ireland, and the United States.
